A ensemble of 20 positive-unlabeled classifiers was trained on known riboswitch sequences (positive) and human 5'UTR sequences (unlabeled).
5'UTR sequences found by all 20 classifiers to be a riboswitch are displayed for the readers convienence [here.](./display_436)

1533 5'UTRs harboring potential riboswitch elements found by one or more classifier of the ensemble are also provided to the reader [here](./display_1533)
